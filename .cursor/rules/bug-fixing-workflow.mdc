# Bug Fixing Workflow
## 1. Understand and Plan
- Upon receiving a bug report, first ensure full understanding of the issue. If unclear, ask for:
    - Steps to reproduce.
    - Expected behavior.
    - Actual behavior observed.
- Before writing any code, provide a **PLAN** that includes:
    - Your **OBSERVATIONS** based on the bug report and any initial code review.
    - Your **REASONING** for the suspected cause.
    - The proposed **FIX**.
    - How the fix will be **TESTED**.
    - [5] Refer to relevant code sections using `@path/to/file.py#L10-L20`.

## 2. Implement the Fix
- Make minimal necessary changes to address the bug.[4] Avoid unrelated refactoring unless explicitly part of the task.
- If the fix involves complex logic, consider adding targeted logging statements to help with verification. You can suggest these logs to the user: "To verify this, I've added logging. Please run the application and provide the log output from [specific action/timeframe]." [11]

## 3. Test the Fix
- After applying the fix, provide clear instructions to the user on how to run the application on their local system to test it. For example: "To test this fix, please run `python main.py --debug_mode` and perform [specific actions related to the bug]."
- Specify what the user should observe to confirm the bug is resolved.
- If applicable, and if a test suite exists, guide the user to run relevant tests (e.g., "Run `pytest tests/test_module_affected.py`").
- If Test-Driven Development (TDD) is preferred for this project, the workflow should be:
    1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug.
    2. Write the minimal code to make the test pass.
    3. Refactor if necessary, ensuring tests still pass. [11]

## 4. Post-Fix
- Once the user confirms the fix, proceed to version control steps as per `version_control_workflow.mdc`.
