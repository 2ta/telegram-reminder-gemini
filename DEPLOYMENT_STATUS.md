2. ✅ **Code Pushed**: Successfully pushed to `origin/main`
3. ✅ **Server Updated**: Server pulled latest changes from repository
4. ✅ **Service Restarted**: Bot service restarted to load new code
5. ✅ **Service Verified**: Service is active and running

## 🔍 Verification Results

### What We Confirmed
- ✅ Server has the latest commit hash (`afc340a`)
- ✅ Service is active and running
- ✅ Service restart was successful

### Connection Issues
- Server connection is unstable for longer commands
- Simple commands work reliably
- Service status commands work

## 📋 Next Steps

### For Testing
1. Test reminder creation flow in the bot
2. Verify callback buttons work correctly
3. Check that reminders are actually created in the database

### For Monitoring
- Monitor bot logs for any errors
- Check if callback handling is working as expected
- Verify that the fix resolves the original issue

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

After this deployment, users should be able to:
1. Create reminders through text or voice input
2. See confirmation prompts with "Set" and "Cancel" buttons
3. Successfully create reminders when clicking "Set"
4. Cancel reminders when clicking "Cancel"

The callback format mismatch that was preventing reminder creation should now be resolved.

## 📞 Support

If issues persist:
1. Check bot logs: `journalctl -u telegram-reminder-bot -f`
2. Verify service status: `systemctl status telegram-reminder-bot`
3. Test callback handling manually
4. Review the documentation in `docs/CALLBACK_HANDLING_FIX.md`
