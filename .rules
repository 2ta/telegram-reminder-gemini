# Deployment Workflow Rules
## Current Status: GitHub Actions Temporarily Disabled
- **GitHub Actions deployment workflow is currently DISABLED** (see commit 7fd7978)
- **Direct SSH deployment is REQUIRED** until GitHub Actions is re-enabled
- All deployments must be performed manually via SSH until the workflow is restored

## Direct Deployment Procedure (Current Method)
- Use SSH connection: `ssh root@45.77.155.59 -p61208`
- Pull latest code from repository
- Update dependencies if needed
- Restart the systemd service: `systemctl restart telegram-reminder-bot`
- Check service status: `systemctl status telegram-reminder-bot`

## GitHub Actions Deployment (When Re-enabled)
- The GitHub Actions deployment workflow (see .github/workflows/deploy.yml) overwrites the systemd service file on every deploy
- Any manual changes to /etc/systemd/system/telegram-reminder-bot.service will be lost on the next deployment
- The workflow uses placeholders (__SSH_USER__, __DEPLOY_PATH__) and replaces them with secrets
- If secrets are missing or incorrect, the service file will be invalid and the bot will not start
- Always check the deployment logs for errors about placeholders or systemd service file issues after deploying
